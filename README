This is a C++ port of the RIBES evalation metric (originally written in Python). You can find a description of the metric in the following paper:

Hideki Isozaki, Tsutomu Hirao, Kevin Duh, Katsuhito Sudoh, and Hajime Tsukada,
"Automatic Evaluation of Translation Quality for Distant Language Pairs",
Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP),
pp. 944--952 Cambridge MA, October, 2010
-- http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/D/D10/D10-1092.pdf

Please note that this program is not the official evaluation software, and any evaluations using RIBES should use the official Python package here:
http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/lirg/ribes/

However, we have confirmed sentence-level accuracy between this package and RIBES 1.02.3 with **one exception**: In the original RIBES, full-width spaces are treated as delimiters, and in this package full-width spaces are treated as words. As a result, if your data contains full width spaces you might get slightly different results.
